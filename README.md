# R packages and sources


## look source code of R packages

- [lookup](https://github.com/jimhester/lookup), **package**, Lookup R full  
  function definitions, including compiled code, S3 and S4 methods.
- [Accessing R Source](https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source), source of R
  function, S3 class and compiled code
  
## visualization

- [ggpointdensity](https://github.com/LKremer/ggpointdensity), **package**, 
  `geom_pointdensity()`: A cross between a scatter plot and a 2D density plot. 
  If you have lots of data points on top of each other, `geom_point()` fails to 
  give you an estimate of how many points are overlapping. `geom_density2d()` and
  geom_bin2d() solve this issue, but they make it impossible to investigate 
  individual outlier points, which may be of interest.
